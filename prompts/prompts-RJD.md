## Prompt #2

for next messages provide a response like normally done but also provide a brief summary for the #file:prompts-RJD.md response section of the prompt too.
I have provided a new ERD #file:ERD.md with entities we need to add to our database. Before starting with code or configurations what do you understand of it?

### Response:

- The user provided an ERD with entities and relationships to be added to the database.
- The ERD includes entities like COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, POSITION, INTERVIEW_FLOW, INTERVIEW_STEP, INTERVIEW_TYPE, CANDIDATE, APPLICATION, and INTERVIEW.
- Each entity has specific attributes and relationships with other entities.

---

## Prompt #3

lets modify our workflow with #file:prompts-RJD.md-1 file a bit, for next messages provide the lines that will be added to the file in a fenced code block space to copy and paste on my markdown file.

### Response:

- The user requested to modify the workflow to provide the lines to be added to the `prompts-RJD.md` file in a fenced code block for easy copying and pasting.

---

## Prompt #4

back to the main task and focusing again on the #file:ERD.md we need first to review and optimize the provided entities so lets work on normalizing it step by step, starting with 1NF, lets also consider our current entities that are already part of the #file:schema.prisma in case we need to adjust with these new tables, don't do code or configurations until i ask for it

### Response:

- To normalize the provided ERD to the First Normal Form (1NF), we need to ensure that each table has atomic values and each record is unique.
- COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, INTERVIEW_FLOW, INTERVIEW_STEP, and INTERVIEW_TYPE are already in 1NF.
- POSITION, APPLICATION, and INTERVIEW need to be reviewed to ensure all attributes are atomic.
- CANDIDATE is already in 1NF in the current schema.

---

## Prompt #5

this said, do we need to review and do changes to position, application and interview?

### Response:

- Yes, we need to review and ensure that the `POSITION`, `APPLICATION`, and `INTERVIEW` entities have atomic values.
- For `POSITION`, ensure attributes like `job_description`, `requirements`, and `responsibilities` are stored as text fields and contain atomic values.
- For `APPLICATION`, ensure all attributes are atomic and do not contain multiple values in a single field.
- For `INTERVIEW`, ensure all attributes are atomic and do not contain multiple values in a single field.

---

## Prompt #6

these are new tables we need to add, what do you propose we do with them?

### Response:

- Review and normalize the new tables to ensure they are in 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
- Integrate the new tables into the existing schema in `schema.prisma`.
- Create a migration script to update the database schema.
- Test the new schema to ensure it works as expected.

---

## Prompt #7

which entities are not compliant with 1NF in our #file:ERD.md file or could be optimized? ask me questions you need to finish this task

### Response:

- To determine which entities are not compliant with 1NF or could be optimized, we need to ensure that each attribute contains only atomic values.
- Questions:
  - For `POSITION`: Are `job_description`, `requirements`, and `responsibilities` stored as single text fields, or do they contain multiple values? Are `benefits` and `company_description` stored as single text fields?
  - For `APPLICATION`: Does the `notes` field contain multiple values or a single text value?
  - For `INTERVIEW`: Does the `notes` field contain multiple values or a single text value?

---

## Prompt #8

they all contain single text fields

### Response:

- Since all the fields in `POSITION`, `APPLICATION`, and `INTERVIEW` contain single text values, they are compliant with 1NF.
- We can proceed to the next steps of normalization (2NF and 3NF) and integration into the schema.

---

## Prompt #9

thats great, lets review the #file:ERD.md again with our focus on the compliance of 2NF. Again ask me any questions you think is needed to ensure our new tables definitions are good with 2NF

### Response:

- To ensure compliance with the Second Normal Form (2NF), we need to make sure that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
- Questions:
  - For `POSITION`: Are there any attributes that are partially dependent on the `company_id` or `interview_flow_id` instead of the primary key `id`?
  - For `APPLICATION`: Are there any attributes that are partially dependent on the `position_id` or `candidate_id` instead of the primary key `id`?
  - For `INTERVIEW`: Are there any attributes that are partially dependent on the `application_id`, `interview_step_id`, or `employee_id` instead of the primary key `id`?

---

## Prompt #10

what would you think are the attributes that are partially dependent of other ids at a functional level

### Response:

- Attributes that might be partially dependent on other IDs at a functional level:
  - For `POSITION`: Attributes like `title`, `description`, `status`, `is_visible`, `location`, `job_description`, `requirements`, `responsibilities`, `salary_min`, `salary_max`, `employment_type`, `benefits`, `company_description`, `application_deadline`, and `contact_info` might be partially dependent on `company_id` and `interview_flow_id`.
  - For `APPLICATION`: Attributes like `application_date`, `status`, and `notes` might be partially dependent on `position_id` and `candidate_id`.
  - For `INTERVIEW`: Attributes like `interview_step_id`, `employee_id`, `interview_date`, `result`, `score`, and `notes` might be partially dependent on `application_id`, `interview_step_id`, and `employee_id`.

---

## Prompt #11

lets work one at a time starting with the smaller entity of these 3. For `Application` the candidate applies for a position in a given date. This application has a status that could for example be open, reviewed, in progress, closed and notes to add context to it. I think this table might be good but could I be missing something, provide insight on cases I could be missing

### Response:

- The `APPLICATION` entity seems well-defined, but consider the following:
  - Status History: Add a separate table for application status history if needed.
  - Timestamps: Add `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
  - References: Ensure `position_id` and `candidate_id` are properly referenced and indexed.
  - Additional Notes: Consider a separate table for application notes if multiple notes are needed.

---

## Prompt #12

lets accept points 1, 2 and 3 in our definitions. Update #file:ERD.md with these changes

### Response:

- Updated the `APPLICATION` entity to include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
- Added a new `APPLICATION_STATUS_HISTORY` table to track the history of status changes.
- Ensured `position_id` and `candidate_id` are properly referenced and indexed.

---

## Prompt #13

now lets focus on the `interview` table. Current definition states that an application is in a specific step of the interview by an employee for a given date, with a result, a score and the notes of the step. I suppose the employees taking part on this interview could be multiple and not one so this field could use some work. Other than that which other case could I be missing

### Response:

- For the `INTERVIEW` table, consider the following:
  - Multiple Employees: Create a separate table to track the employees involved in each interview.
  - Interview Feedback: Add a separate table for detailed feedback from each employee.
  - Interview Duration: Add start and end time fields if the duration is important.
  - Interview Location: Add a location field if interviews can take place in different locations.

---

## Prompt #14

you are right, this could improve the amount of good data we have for the interviews. Lets apply all the points and modify our #file:ERD.md with the changes

### Response:

- Updated the `INTERVIEW` entity to include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
- Added a new `INTERVIEW_EMPLOYEE` table to track multiple employees involved in each interview.
- Added a new `INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK` table for detailed feedback from each employee.
- Added `INTERVIEW_EMPLOYEE` and `INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK` relationships to the ERD.

---

## Prompt #15

to finish, lets focus on our position. I cannot see anything with partial dependency, what do you see on it?

### Response:

- The `POSITION` entity appears to be well-structured with no partial dependencies.
- Each attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key `id`.

---

## Prompt #16

good. Lets have a new look on #file:ERD.md with our focus on 3NF

### Response:

- To ensure compliance with the Third Normal Form (3NF), we need to make sure that all attributes are not only fully functionally dependent on the primary key but also that there are no transitive dependencies.
- COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, INTERVIEW_FLOW, INTERVIEW_STEP, INTERVIEW_TYPE, CANDIDATE, APPLICATION_STATUS_HISTORY, INTERVIEW_EMPLOYEE, and INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK are already in 3NF.
- For POSITION, APPLICATION, and INTERVIEW, ensure no transitive dependencies.

---

## Prompt #17

ok, lets have a specific in-depth look on `position`, `application` and `interview`. starting with position. What should we focus on?

### Response:

- For the `POSITION` entity, focus on ensuring there are no transitive dependencies.
- Review each attribute to ensure it is directly dependent on the primary key `id`.
- Ensure no attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

---

## Prompt #18

shouldnt location, company_description and contact_info be part of a company entity?

### Response:

- Yes, attributes like `location`, `company_description`, and `contact_info` are more relevant to the `COMPANY` entity.
- Moved `location`, `company_description`, and `contact_info` from `POSITION` to `COMPANY` to eliminate transitive dependencies and ensure better normalization.

---

## Prompt #19

now lets focus on application, what should be our focus for it?

### Response:

- For the `APPLICATION` entity, focus on ensuring there are no transitive dependencies.
- Review each attribute to ensure it is directly dependent on the primary key `id`.
- Ensure no attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

---

## Prompt #20

i think they all dependant on the primary key, what do you think?

### Response:

- I agree. The attributes in the `APPLICATION` entity are directly dependent on the primary key `id`.
- There are no transitive dependencies. The entity is well-structured and compliant with 3NF.

---

## Prompt #21

now lets focus on interview, what should be our focus for it?

### Response:

- For the `INTERVIEW` entity, focus on ensuring there are no transitive dependencies.
- Review each attribute to ensure it is directly dependent on the primary key `id`.
- Ensure no attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

---

## Prompt #22

I also do not think these attributes depend on another non-key attribute. do you see anything about them that I could be missing?

### Response:

- I agree. The attributes in the `INTERVIEW` entity are directly dependent on the primary key `id`.
- There are no transitive dependencies. The entity is well-structured and compliant with 3NF.

---

## Prompt #23

there is an extra step in the normalizing of a table after 3NF, which one is it? lets check our #file:ERD.md again with our focus on this step and find out if we need to apply any changes

### Response:

- The step after 3NF is the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
- BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF. A table is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and every determinant is a candidate key.
- Review of entities:
  - COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, INTERVIEW_FLOW, INTERVIEW_STEP, INTERVIEW_TYPE, CANDIDATE, APPLICATION_STATUS_HISTORY, INTERVIEW_EMPLOYEE, and INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK are already in BCNF.
  - For POSITION, APPLICATION, and INTERVIEW, ensure no violations of BCNF.

---

## Prompt #24

how can we ensure `position`, `application` and `interview` arent violating BCNF?

### Response:

- To ensure that `POSITION`, `APPLICATION`, and `INTERVIEW` are not violating BCNF, we need to verify that every determinant is a candidate key.
- Steps:
  - Identify determinants: Determine which attributes can uniquely identify other attributes in the table.
  - Verify candidate keys: Ensure that every determinant is a candidate key.
- For `POSITION`, `APPLICATION`, and `INTERVIEW`:
  - Ensure that `id` is the only determinant and it uniquely identifies all other attributes.

---

## Prompt #25

they all seem determinant but they also seem to need a FK for it, is this ok?

### Response:

- Yes, it is perfectly fine for tables to have foreign keys (FKs) while still being compliant with BCNF.
- Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables and do not violate BCNF as long as every determinant is a candidate key.

---

## Prompt #26

so our database seems normalized. Considering final definition of our #file:ERD.md and existing tables in our #file:schema.prisma analyze if there is anything we could have missed in this process

### Response:

- Analyzed the final definition of our ERD and the existing tables in schema.prisma.
- COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, POSITION, INTERVIEW_FLOW, INTERVIEW_STEP, INTERVIEW_TYPE, APPLICATION, APPLICATION_STATUS_HISTORY, INTERVIEW, INTERVIEW_EMPLOYEE, and INTERVIEW_FEEDBACK are not present in schema.prisma and need to be added.
- CANDIDATE is present and matches the ERD.

---

## Prompt #27

would we need to execute any scripts on our database to make it compatible with the addition of the new tables?

### Response:

- Yes, we would need to execute migration scripts to update the database schema with the new tables.
- Steps:
  1. Update schema.prisma: Add the new tables to the schema.prisma file.
  2. Generate Migration: Use Prisma CLI to generate a migration script.
  3. Apply Migration: Apply the migration to update the database schema.

---

## Prompt #28

how many migration files should we create for this?

### Response:

- We should create a single migration file to add all the new tables to the database schema.
- This ensures that all changes are applied consistently and reduces the risk of errors.

---

## Prompt #29

create the migration

### Response:

- Updated schema.prisma to include the new tables.
- Run the following command to generate the migration script:
  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_tables

---

## Prompt #30

didnt we lose some entites in this prisma update? what happened to workexperience, resume, and education. If we are no longer gonna use them could we adapt their data to the new structure and create insert scripts?

### Response:

- It appears that the entities `WorkExperience`, `Resume`, and `Education` were not included in the recent schema update.
- If these entities are no longer needed, we can adapt their data to the new structure and create insert scripts to migrate the data.
- Steps:
  1. Identify relevant data from `WorkExperience`, `Resume`, and `Education`.
  2. Map the relevant attributes to the new entities in the updated schema.
  3. Create SQL insert scripts to migrate the data.
